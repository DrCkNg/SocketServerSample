# SocketServerSample
Socket Server Sample is a simple Socket Server application which listens to a dedicated Port for a string with CR(13) LF(10) as string terminator. It replies the client data (with an optional acknowledge appendix, Trigger Command Ack) with the original data and an increasing counter number.
